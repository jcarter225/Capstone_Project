# Capstone_Project

This repository contains my capstone project for the University of Wisconsin - Superior. The capstone course was the final course necessary to complete the M.S. Master's program at the University.

This project aimed to determine the most influential factors in NCAA football game outcomes for the 2022 season. Pursuant to that task, team statistics were collected (via the official NCAA website), and game outcome data was scraped from cbssports.com. This data was merged to create weekly datasets for the 2022 season. These data were then analyzed via random forest models in order to determine the relative importance of team statistics in determining game outcomes (win/loss). 

The "All Code" folder contains all code utilized in the project. The Dataset Creator file is the code utilized to merge and clean team statistics and game outcome data. NCAA_Football_2022_Analysis contains the actual analysis of the weekly datasets. This folder also contains the Python scripts utilized to scrape game outcome data from cbssports.com. 

The "Finalized Datasets and Analysis" folder contains the cleaned and merged datasets created by the Dataset Creator file, as well as a copy of the analysis of those datasets. 

The final paper for the capstone project can also be found in this repository. The aim of this paper was to provide a brief history of the sport of college football, to provide examples of entities that may find analyses like this useful, to contextualize this work within other academic pieces, and to present and explain the results of the analysis.
